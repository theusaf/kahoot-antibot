<h2>How to improve anti-botting:</h2>
<p>Sometimes, just an antibot is not enough... Here are ways to prevent bots from joining your games to the best of your ability</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Enable Friendly Names</b> - This brings out the most power of the antibot, blocking 99% of bots. (until someone realized how to bypass this)</li>
<li><b>Enable 2FA</b> - Many bots try to brute force this. The AntiBot detects this and can block them.</li>
<li><b>Enable Team Mode</b> - Many bots are not used to joining as a team yet. This can kill off some of the more persistant bots.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features planned:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nothing currently!</li>
<p>Most things have been blocked, so not much to plan now.</p>
