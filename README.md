<h4>Note:</h4>
<ul>
<li>This script might kick actual players if their names are too similar to that of bots, or there is more than one player with a number name.</li>
<li>This script might kick players if botters maliciously set the name of the bots to be similar to an existing player.</li>
<li><del>This script will not kick bots that join the game after you press start.</del></li>
<li><del>Edit: now bans leaderboard bots!</del></li>
<li>Edit: Bans all bots everywhere!</li>

<h2>How to improve anti-botting:</h2>
<p>Sometimes, just an antibot is not enough... Here are ways to prevent bots from joining your games to the best of your ability</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Enable Friendly Names</b> - This brings out the most power of the antibot, blocking 99% of bots. (until someone realized how to bypass this)</li>
<li><b>Enable 2FA</b> - Many bots try to brute force this. The AntiBot detects this and can block them.</li>
<li><b>Enable Team Mode</b> - While team mode no longer prevents most bots from joining, it can help filter out some bots that use the same patters for teams. Some bots may still not support team mode, so this will help.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Features planned:</h2>
<ul>
<li>More Blocking Options.</li>
<li>A way to automatically use the latest Kahoot! code, instead of manually updating it.</li>
<ul>
<li>first[._-]last</li>
<li>etc</li>
